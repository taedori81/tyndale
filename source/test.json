        "body": "<p>\u00a0 \u00a0<b> William Tyndale</b> (/\u02c8t\u026and\u0259l/;[1] sometimes spelled Tynsdale, Tindall, Tindill, Tyndall; c. 1494\u20131536) was an English scholar who became a leading figure in Protestant reform in the years leading up to his execution. He is well known for his translation of the Bible into English. He was influenced by the work of Desiderius Erasmus, who made the Greek New Testament available in Europe, and by Martin Luther.[2] While a number of partial translations had been made from the seventh century onward, the spread of Wycliffe's Bible resulted in a death sentence for any unlicensed possession of Scripture in English\u2014even though translations in all other major European languages had been accomplished and made available.[3][4] Tyndale's translation was the first English Bible to draw directly from Hebrew and Greek texts, the first English one to take advantage of the printing press, and first of the new English Bibles of the Reformation. It was taken to be a direct challenge to the hegemony of both the Roman Catholic Church and the laws of England to maintain the church's position. In 1530, Tyndale also wrote The Practyse of Prelates, opposing Henry VIII's divorce from Catherine of Aragon on the grounds that it contravened Scripture.Reuchlin's Hebrew grammar was published in 1506. Tyndale worked in an age in which Greek was available to the European scholarly community for the first time in centuries. Erasmus compiled and edited Greek Scriptures into the Textus Receptus\u2014ironically, to improve upon the Latin Vulgate\u2014following the Renaissance-fueling Fall of Constantinople in 1453 and the dispersion of Greek-speaking intellectuals and texts into a Europe which previously had access to none. When a copy of The Obedience of a Christian Man fell into the hands of Henry VIII, the king found the rationale to break the Church in England from the Roman Catholic Church in 1534.[5][6][page needed]In 1535, Tyndale was arrested and jailed in the castle of Vilvoorde (Filford) outside Brussels for over a year. In 1536 he was convicted of heresy and executed by strangulation, after which his body was burnt at the stake. His dying prayer that the King of England's eyes would be opened seemed to find its fulfillment just two years later with Henry's authorization of The Great Bible for the Church of England\u2014which was largely Tyndale's own work. Hence, the Tyndale Bible, as it was known, continued to play a key role in spreading Reformation ideas across the English-speaking world and, eventually, to the British Empire.In 1611, the 54 scholars who produced the King James Bible drew significantly from Tyndale, as well as from translations that descended from his. One estimate suggests the New Testament in the King James Version is 83% Tyndale's and the Old Testament 76%.[7] With his translation of the Bible the first to be printed in English, and a model for subsequent English translations, in 2002, Tyndale was placed at number 26 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.[8][9]\n\n-from Wikipedia</p>",

He is King of kings and Lord of lords, and in Him are found all the treasures of God. The Apostle Paul reminds us He must have the preeminence, and by Him all things consist. These truths have profound implications for education, since we know from the book of Proverbs that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of both knowledge and wisdom.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At Tyndale International University, we seek to bring all thoughts captive to the Lordship of Christ. This educational approach is what is referred to as a Christian world-and-life view. Not every institution that identifies itself as Christian understands this perspective. What you will discover at Tyndale International University therefore is rare--an institution of higher learning that starts with the wisdom of God as recorded in His Word, the Bible, and which builds on that infallible foundation.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are far from perfect, of course, in our understanding and in our application of that knowledge. Nevertheless, we are sincere in our endeavor. And we invite you to join us in this great enterprise.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/></p>"

We are commissioned to foster and produce faithful and truthful leaders in our societies and churches. In this diversified generation, we can't speak enough of how crucial and significant education is.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Education is a tool/instrument that helps us to realize, develop, and improve our individual talents that God has bestowed upon us. And the ultimate goal for the education is to become somebody who is needed and important. Additionally, we all have a privilege and right to be educated.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tyndale International University exists for that particular purpose and aim. This is an education that advances and moves forward from Christian mind to conservative Reformed Calvinism grounded on theology and faith derived from the Scriptures. I, this nation, and this generation will labor and toil as the lighthouse that shines the light in this world and as the salt that protects the world from deteriorating and decaying.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tyndale International University will eagerly assist and contribute to those who passionately longing for education but are unable to pursue their goals due to their jobs and/or environmental situations they are in. We plan to have night classes and other ways/methods to help them accomplish their dreams.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0''Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling\u00a0\u00a0the word of truth.''

        "body": "<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At Tyndale International University, we make a solemn declaration of faith on the basis of the Scriptures as follows:<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Bible is the inerrant and divinely inspired word of God. There is one God, eternally existing and manifesting Himself to us in three Persons; the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.\u00a0\u00a0God, by His Word and for His glory, freely created the world in six days from nothing and created man, male and female, in His own image, to have fellowship with Him. The existence of the creation is not explainable apart from the roles of God as the sovereign Creator and Sustainer of the entire natural realm. Concepts such as theistic or threshold evolution do not adequately explain the wonder of God\u2019s creation.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tempted by Satan, the whole human race fell in the fall of the first Adam. All men, until they accept the Lord Jesus as their personal Savior, are lost, darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, hardened in heart, are are morally and spiritually dead through their trespasses and sins.\u00a0\u00a0They cannot see, nor enter the kingdom of God until they are born again of the Holy Spirit.\u00a0\u00a0The only Mediator between God and humankind is Jesus Christ our Lord, the eternal Son of God. Jesus Christ revealed His divine love and upheld divine justice through His death on the cross, in our place, revealing our guilt and reconciling us to God. All have sinned through Adam, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Christ redeemed us from sin through His death on the cross. On the third day He rose bodily from the grave, victorious over death and power over darkness. He ascended to heaven where, at God's right hand, He intercedes for His people and rules as Lord overall.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The true Church is composed of all such persons who through saving faith in Jesus Christ have been regenerated by the Holy Spirit and are united together in the body of Christ. The Holy Spirit is a Person, and is possessed of all the distinctively divine attributes. He is God.\u00a0\u00a0God's redemptive purpose will be consummated by the return of Christ to raise the dead, to judge all people according to the deeds done in the body and to establish His glorious kingdom. All those who receive Jesus Christ as their Savior and their Lord, and who confess Him as such, become children of God and receive eternal life, and become heirs of God. At death their spirits depart to be with Christ in conscious blessedness, and at the Second Coming of Christ their bodies shall be raised and transformed into glorious bodies. They shall live and reign with Him forever.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The wicked shall be separated from God's presence. All those who persistently reject Jesus Christ in the present life shall be raised from the dead and throughout eternity exist in the state of conscious, endless torment and anguish in hell. Satan, an evil being of cunningness, shall ultimately be cast into the lake of fire and brimstone and shall be tormented day and night forever.\u00a0\u00a0We believe in Westminster Confession of Faith and Heidelberg Catechismas being faithful and truthful to the teachings of the Bible, and as best representing the conventional Reformed faith.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We denunciate liberalism and humanism, however, we believe that the faith rooted and centered on conservative faith that is derived from Calvinism\u2019s reformed faith and faith centered on the Bible will revive today\u2019s churches and will lead believers to their spiritual growth.<br/></p>",

One estimate suggests the New Testament in the King James Version is 83% Tyndale's and the Old Testament 76%.[7] With his translation of the Bible the first to be printed in English, and a model for subsequent English translations, in 2002, Tyndale was placed at number 26 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.[8][9]\\n\\n-from Wikipedia</p>\", \"owner\": 1, \"subsection_title\": \"About\", \"expire_at\": null, \"expired\": false, \"latest_revision_created_at\": \"2015-08-05T23:32:14.857Z\", \"seo_title\": \"\", \"numchild\": 1, \"main_image\": 1, \"pk\": 4, \"depth\": 3, \"first_published_at\": \"2015-08-05T20:19:13.950Z\", \"locked\": false, \"slug\": \"about\", \"path\": \"000100010001\", \"show_in_menus\": true, \"has_unpublished_changes\": false}",

There is one God, eternally existing and manifesting Himself to us in three Persons; the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.\\u00a0\\u00a0God, by His Word and for His glory, freely created the world in six days from nothing and created man, male and female, in His own image, to have fellowship with Him. The existence of the creation is not explainable apart from the roles of God as the sovereign Creator and Sustainer of the entire natural realm. Concepts such as theistic or threshold evolution do not adequately explain the wonder of God\\u2019s creation.<br/>\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Tempted by Satan, the whole human race fell in the fall of the first Adam. All men, until they accept the Lord Jesus as their personal Savior, are lost, darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, hardened in heart, are are morally and spiritually dead through their trespasses and sins.\\u00a0\\u00a0They cannot see, nor enter the kingdom of God until they are born again of the Holy Spirit.\\u00a0\\u00a0The only Mediator between God and humankind is Jesus Christ our Lord, the eternal Son of God. Jesus Christ revealed His divine love and upheld divine justice through His death on the cross, in our place, revealing our guilt and reconciling us to God. All have sinned through Adam, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Christ redeemed us from sin through His death on the cross. On the third day He rose bodily from the grave, victorious over death and power over darkness. He ascended to heaven where, at God's right hand, He intercedes for His people and rules as Lord overall.<br/>\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0The true Church is composed of all such persons who through saving faith in Jesus Christ have been regenerated by the Holy Spirit and are united together in the body of Christ. The Holy Spirit is a Person, and is possessed of all the distinctively divine attributes. He is God.\\u00a0\\u00a0God's redemptive purpose will be consummated by the return of Christ to raise the dead, to judge all people according to the deeds done in the body and to establish His glorious kingdom. All those who receive Jesus Christ as their Savior and their Lord, and who confess Him as such, become children of God and receive eternal life, and become heirs of God. At death their spirits depart to be with Christ in conscious blessedness, and at the Second Coming of Christ their bodies shall be raised and transformed into glorious bodies. They shall live and reign with Him forever.<br/>\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0The wicked shall be separated from God's presence. All those who persistently reject Jesus Christ in the present life shall be raised from the dead and throughout eternity exist in the state of conscious, endless torment and anguish in hell. Satan, an evil being of cunningness, shall ultimately be cast into the lake of fire and brimstone and shall be tormented day and night forever.\\u00a0\\u00a0We believe in Westminster Confession of Faith and Heidelberg Catechismas being faithful and truthful to the teachings of the Bible, and as best representing the conventional Reformed faith.<br/>\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0We denunciate liberalism and humanism, however, we believe that the faith rooted and centered on conservative faith that is derived from Calvinism\\u2019s reformed faith and faith centered on the Bible will revive today\\u2019s churches and will lead believers to their spiritual growth.<br/></p>\", \"seo_title\": \"\", \"title\": \"State of Faith\", \"live\": true, \"search_description\": \"\", \"path\": \"0001000100010004\", \"expire_at\": null, \"has_unpublished_changes\": false, \"locked\": false}",

The University admits students of any race, color, creed, and sex, regardless of national or ethnic origin or physical handicap.
